## Package Setup

Let's get started by installing the dependencies and setting up your environment

<Steps>

### Install the package

{props.children}

### Add env variables

<Callout>
  If you don't already have a uploadthing secret key, [sign
  up](https://uploadthing.com/sign-in) and create one from the
  [dashboard!](https://uploadthing.com/dashboard)
</Callout>

```bash copy
UPLOADTHING_SECRET="sk_live_xxx" # A secret key for your app
UPLOADTHING_APP_ID='xxx' # Your app id
```

<Callout type="info">
  If you're not deploying through Vercel, you also need to add a
  `UPLOADTHING_URL` environment variable that points to your app, e.g.
  `https://myapp.com`. This variable can also be used to override the default
  URL in development which is `http://localhost:3000` unless specified
  otherwise.
