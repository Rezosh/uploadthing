## Set Up A FileRouter

All files uploaded to UploadThing are associated with a FileRoute. To get full
insight into what you can do with the FileRoutes, please refer to the
[File Router API](/api-reference/server#file-routes).

The router below has a single file route, allowing users to upload an image up
to 4MB. We run an auth check in our middleware, meaning only authenticated users
can upload files. After the upload has completed, we update our users profile
image to the newly uploaded file.
