# Usage with Next.js Pages Router

<PackageSetup>

```bash npm2yarn copy
npm install uploadthing @uploadthing/react
```

</PackageSetup>

<FileRouterSetup>

```tsx copy filename="server/uploadthing.ts"
import { createUploadthing, type FileRouter } from "uploadthing/next-legacy";

import { auth } from "~/server/auth";
import { db } from "~/server/db";

const f = createUploadthing();

export const uploadRouter = {
  imageUploader: f({ image: { maxFileSize: "4MB" } })
    .middleware(async ({ req, res }) => {
      // This code runs on your server before upload
      // If the request isn't authenticated, we throw and cancel the upload
      const user = await auth(req, res);
      if (!user) throw new Error("Unauthorized");

      // Whatever is returned here is accessible in onUploadComplete as `metadata`
      return { userId: user.id };
    })
    .onUploadComplete(async ({ metadata, file }) => {
      // This code RUNS ON YOUR SERVER after upload
      console.log("Upload complete for userId:", metadata.userId);

      await db.users
        .update({ imageUrl: file.url })
        .where({ id: metadata.userId });
    }),
} satisfies FileRouter;

export type OurFileRouter = typeof uploadRouter;
```

</FileRouterSetup>

## Expose the FileRouter as HTTP endpoints

To expose the FileRouter as HTTP endpoints, create a new API route and pass in
your FileRouter:

<Callout type="warning">
  Note: This is the ONLY FILE WHERE THE PATH MATTERS. You need to serve this API
  from `/api/uploadthing` as it is called via webhook to trigger
  `onUploadComplete`.
</Callout>

```ts copy filename="pages/api/uploadthing.ts"
import { createNextPageApiHandler } from "uploadthing/next-legacy";

import { ourFileRouter } from "~/server/uploadthing";

// Export routes for Next Pages Router
export default createNextPageApiHandler({
  router: ourFileRouter,
});
```

## Setup UploadThing for React

UploadThing provides premade components, as well as a powerful hook that let's
you upload files in your React application. See the
[React docs](/frontend/react) for more information.
