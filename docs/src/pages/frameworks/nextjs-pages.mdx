# Usage with Next.js Pages Router

<Steps>

### Update import in `~/server/uploadthing.ts`

API routes in Next.js pages router is not based on the web standard `Request`
and `Response`, but instead uses an Express-like API using `NextApiRequest` and
`NextApiResponse`. To get the correct types in your middleware function, update
the import as follows:

```diff filename="server/uploadthing.ts"
- import { createUploadthing, type FileRouter } from "uploadthing/server";
+ import { createUploadthing, type FileRouter } from "uploadthing/next-legacy";
```

You should now see that the type of `req` is `NextApiRequest` and you'll also
have access to a `res` object:

```ts
imageUploader: f({ image: { maxFileSize: "4MB" } }).middleware(
  async ({ req, res }) => {
    // This code runs on your server before upload
    // If the request isn't authenticated, we throw and cancel the upload
    const user = await auth(req, res);
    if (!user) throw new Error("Unauthorized");

    // Whatever is returned here is accessible in onUploadComplete as `metadata`
    return { userId: user.id };
  },
);
```

### Expose the FileRouter as HTTP endpoints

To expose the FileRouter as HTTP endpoints, create a new API route and pass in
your FileRouter:

<Callout type="warning">
  Note: This is the ONLY FILE WHERE THE PATH MATTERS. You need to serve this API
  from `/api/uploadthing` as it is called via webhook to trigger
  `onUploadComplete`.
</Callout>

```ts copy filename="pages/api/uploadthing.ts"
import { createNextPageApiHandler } from "uploadthing/next-legacy";

import { uploadRouter } from "~/server/uploadthing";

// Export routes for Next Pages Router
export default createNextPageApiHandler({
  router: uploadRouter,
});
```

### Setup UploadThing for React

Install the React package:

```bash copy npm2yarn
npm install @uploadthing/react
```

`@uploadthing/react` provides premade components, as well as a powerful hook
that let's you upload files in your React application. See the
[React docs](/frontend/react) for more information.
