# Usage with Next.js App Router

<PackageSetup>

```bash npm2yarn copy
npm install uploadthing @uploadthing/react
```

</PackageSetup>

<FileRouterSetup>

```ts copy filename="server/uploadthing.ts"
import { createUploadthing, type FileRouter } from "uploadthing/next";

import { auth } from "~/server/auth";
import { db } from "~/server/db";

const f = createUploadthing();

export const uploadRouter = {
  imageUploader: f({ image: { maxFileSize: "4MB" } })
    .middleware(async ({ req }) => {
      // This code runs on your server before upload
      // If the request isn't authenticated, we throw and cancel the upload
      const user = await auth(req);
      if (!user) throw new Error("Unauthorized");

      // Whatever is returned here is accessible in onUploadComplete as `metadata`
      return { userId: user.id };
    })
    .onUploadComplete(async ({ metadata, file }) => {
      // This code RUNS ON YOUR SERVER after upload
      console.log("Upload complete for userId:", metadata.userId);

      await db.users
        .update({ imageUrl: file.url })
        .where({ id: metadata.userId });
    }),
} satisfies FileRouter;

export type OurFileRouter = typeof uploadRouter;
```

</FileRouterSetup>

## Expose the FileRouter as HTTP endpoints

To expose the FileRouter as HTTP endpoints, create a new route handler and pass
in your FileRouter:

<Callout type="warning">
  Note: This is the ONLY FILE WHERE THE PATH MATTERS. You need to serve this API
  from `/api/uploadthing` as it is called via webhook to trigger
  `onUploadComplete`.
</Callout>

```ts copy filename="app/api/uploadthing/route.ts"
import { createNextRouteHandler } from "uploadthing/next";

import { uploadRouter } from "~/server/uploadthing";

// Export routes for Next App Router
export const { GET, POST } = createNextRouteHandler({
  router: uploadRouter,
});
```

## Setup UploadThing for React

UploadThing provides premade components, as well as a powerful hook that let's
you upload files in your React application. See the
[React docs](/frontend/react) for more information.

## Configure automatic hydration during SSR (recommended)

> Added in `v5.6`

By default, `useUploadThing` (and thus also the premade components) will fetch
your server for the route endpoint permissions which will show a loading state.
By utilizing server components, we can pre-hydrate this data on the server
instead to avoid the loading state and show the route permissions immediately.
This also means no client-side fetch requests are made.

To add SSR hydration for all uploadthing components, simply render the
`<NextSSRPlugin />` hydration helper in the body of your root layout **before**
the children. The before and after is shown below (refresh page to see the
difference):

import { WithoutSSR, WithSSR } from "../../components/ssr-diff";

<div className="mt-6 flex items-center justify-center gap-8">
  <WithoutSSR />
  <WithSSR />
</div>

```tsx copy filename="app/layout.tsx"
import { NextSSRPlugin } from "@uploadthing/react/next-ssr-plugin";
import { extractRouterConfig } from "uploadthing/server";

import { uploadRouter } from "~/server/uploadthing";

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <NextSSRPlugin
          /**
           * The `extractRouterConfig` will extract **only** the route configs
           * from the router to prevent additional information from being
           * leaked to the client. The data passed to the client is the same
           * as if you were to fetch `/api/uploadthing` directly.
           */
          routerConfig={extractRouterConfig(uploadRouter)}
        />
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```
