# Usage with SolidStart

<PackageSetup>

```bash npm2yarn copy
npm install uploadthing @uploadthing/solid solidjs-dropzone attr-accept
```

</PackageSetup>

<FileRouterSetup>

```ts copy filename="server/uploadthing.ts"
import { createUploadthing, type FileRouter } from "uploadthing/server";

import { auth } from "~/server/auth";
import { db } from "~/server/db";

const f = createUploadthing();

export const uploadRouter = {
  imageUploader: f({ image: { maxFileSize: "4MB" } })
    .middleware(async ({ req }) => {
      // This code runs on your server before upload
      // If the request isn't authenticated, we throw and cancel the upload
      const user = await auth(req);
      if (!user) throw new Error("Unauthorized");

      // Whatever is returned here is accessible in onUploadComplete as `metadata`
      return { userId: user.id };
    })
    .onUploadComplete(async ({ metadata, file }) => {
      // This code RUNS ON YOUR SERVER after upload
      console.log("Upload complete for userId:", metadata.userId);

      await db.users
        .update({ imageUrl: file.url })
        .where({ id: metadata.userId });
    }),
} satisfies FileRouter;

export type OurFileRouter = typeof uploadRouter;
```

</FileRouterSetup>

## Expose the FileRouter as HTTP endpoints

<Callout type="warning">
  **Note:** This is the ONLY FILE WHERE THE PATH MATTERS. You need to serve this
  API from `/api/uploadthing` on your application.
</Callout>

```ts copy filename="src/routes/api/uploadthing.ts"
import { createServerHandler } from "uploadthing/server";

import { uploadRouter } from "~/server/uploadthing";

export const { GET, POST } = createServerHandler({
  router: uploadRouter,
  config: {
    callbackUrl: `http://localhost:${process.env.PORT ?? 3000}/api/uploadthing`,
  },
});
```

## Setup UploadThing for Solid.js

UploadThing provides premade components, as well as a powerful hook that let's
you upload files in your Solid.js application. See the
[Solid.js docs](/frontend/solid) for more information.
