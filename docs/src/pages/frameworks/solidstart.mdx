# Usage with SolidStart

<Callout type="info">
  Make sure you've gone through the [getting started](/getting-started) before

</Callout>

SolidStart is based on the web standard `Request` and `Response`, so you don't
have to do any modifications to your file router.

<Steps>

### Expose the FileRouter as HTTP endpoints

Once you've created your file router, it's time to expose it as a new route
handler. Create a new API route in `src/routes/api/uploadthing.ts` and add the
following:

```ts copy filename="src/routes/api/uploadthing.ts"
import { createServerHandler } from "uploadthing/server";

import { uploadRouter } from "~/server/uploadthing";

export const { GET, POST } = createServerHandler({
  router: uploadRouter,
});
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Note: This is the ONLY FILE WHERE THE PATH MATTERS. You need to serve this API
  from `/api/uploadthing` as it is called via webhook to trigger
  `onUploadComplete`.
</Callout>

### Setup UploadThing for Solid.js

Install the necessary packages:

```bash copy npm2yarn
npm install @uploadthing/solid solidjs-dropzone attr-accept
```

`@uploadthing/solid` provides premade components, as well as a powerful hook
that let's you upload files in your Solid.js application. See the
[Solid.js docs](/frontend/solid) for more information.

</Steps>
