## Usage with Solid.js

The `@uploadthing/solid` package provides a set of premade Solid.js components
that you can use to upload files to your server. It also provides a set of hooks
that you can use to build your own custom components.

### Creating The UploadThing Components (recommended)

While you can import the components directly from `@uploadthing/solid`, we
recommend generating your own components using the `generateComponents`
function. This lets you pass your generic `FileRouter` once and then have
typesafe components everywhere, instead of having to pass the generic everytime
you mount a component.

```ts copy filename="src/utils/uploadthing.ts"
import { generateComponents } from "@uploadthing/solid";

import type { OurFileRouter } from "~/server/uploadthing";

// URL is only needed for server side rendering
const url = `http://localhost:${process.env.PORT ?? 3000}`;

export const { UploadButton, UploadDropzone, Uploader } =
  generateComponents<OurFileRouter>(url);
```

### Include our stylesheet

You need to import our styles for the button to look right. Import this in the
`root.tsx` makes it available everywhere.

```tsx copy filename="src/root.tsx"
import "@uploadthing/solid/styles.css";

export default function Root() {
  ...
}
```

### Use the FileRouter in your app

UploadThing provides a few premade components that you can use to upload files
in your app. For component customization, see [Theming](/theming), and for even
more advanced use cases check out the
[hook usage](#advanced-usage-useuploadthing)

#### UploadButton

A simple button that opens the native file picker when clicked. It lists what
files are allowed and how many files can be uploaded of that type.

{/* using React package since Nextra can't mount Solid components, but they look the same */}

import { UploadButton } from "@uploadthing/react";

<UploadButton
  __internal_button_disabled
  __internal_state="ready"
  content={{
    allowedContent: "Allowed content",
    button: "Ready",
  }}
/>

```tsx copy
// Or import from your typed, generated components
import { UploadButton } from "@uploadthing/solid";

import type { OurFileRouter } from "~/server/uploadthing";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main>
      <UploadButton<OurFileRouter>
        endpoint="profileImage"
        // needed when server side rendering
        url="http://localhost:3000"
        onClientUploadComplete={() => {
          alert("Upload Completed");
        }}
        onUploadError={(error: Error) => {
          // Do something with the error.
          alert(`ERROR! ${error.message}`);
        }}
      />
    </main>
  );
}
```

#### UploadDropzone

This is a SolidJS dropzone component that you can use to upload files, you can
drag files into it.

import { UploadDropzone } from "@uploadthing/react";

<UploadDropzone
  __internal_state="ready"
  __internal_button_disabled
  __internal_dropzone_disabled
  __internal_show_button
  content={{
    allowedContent: "Allowed content",
    button: "Ready",
  }}
/>

```tsx copy
// Or import from your typed, generated components
import { UploadDropzone } from "@uploadthing/solid";

import type { OurFileRouter } from "~/server/uploadthing";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main>
      <UploadDropzone<OurFileRouter>
        endpoint="profileImage"
        // needed when server side rendering
        url="http://localhost:3000"
        onClientUploadComplete={() => {
          alert("Upload Completed");
        }}
        onUploadError={(error: Error) => {
          // Do something with the error.
          alert(`ERROR! ${error.message}`);
        }}
      />
    </main>
  );
}
```

#### Uploader

A combination of the `UploadButton` and `UploadDropzone` components.

```tsx copy
// Or import from your typed, generated components
import { Uploader } from "@uploadthing/solid";

import type { OurFileRouter } from "~/server/uploadthing";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main>
      <Uploader<OurFileRouter>
        endpoint="profileImage"
        // needed when server side rendering
        url="http://localhost:3000"
        onClientUploadComplete={() => {
          alert("Upload Completed");
        }}
      />
    </main>
  );
}
```

## Advanced usage: `useUploadThing`

For advanced use cases, the premade components might not be flexible enough to
suit your needs. In that case, you can use the `useUploadThing` hook to build
your own components with a custom upload flow:

<Steps>

### Create the hook

First, generate a typed hook using the `generateSolidHelpers` function from
`@uploadthing/solid`:

```tsx copy filename="src/utils/uploadthing.ts"
import { generateSolidHelpers } from "@uploadthing/solid";

import type { OurFileRouter } from "~/server/uploadthing";

export const { useUploadThing } = generateSolidHelpers<OurFileRouter>();
```

### Use the hook

Then, use the hook in your component. By using the hook, you have full control
of when and how to upload files.

```tsx copy filename="src/routes/index.tsx"
import { useUploadThing } from "~/utils/uploadthing";

async function compress(file: File) {
  // Run some compression algorithm on the file
  return file;
}

export default function Home() {
  const { startUpload } = useUploadThing("profileImage", {
    onClientUploadComplete: () => {
      alert("Upload Completed");
    },
  });

  return (
    <main>
      <input
        type="file"
        onChange={async (e) => {
          const file = e.target.files?.[0];
          if (!file) return;

          // Do something with the file before uploading
          const compressed = await compress(file);

          // Then start the upload of the compressed file
          await startUpload([compressed]);
        }}
      />
    </main>
  );
}
```
