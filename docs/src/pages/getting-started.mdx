import { Callout, Steps } from "nextra-theme-docs";

# Getting Started

> These docs assume you're using Next.js - docs for other frameworks coming
> soon!

## Package Setup

<Steps>

### Install the packages

import { Tab, Tabs } from "nextra-theme-docs";

```bash copy npm2yarn
npm install uploadthing @uploadthing/react
```

### Add env variables

```bash
UPLOADTHING_SECRET=... # A secret key for your app (starts with sk_live_)
```

<Callout type="info">
  If you're not deploying through Vercel, you also need to add a
  `UPLOADTHING_URL` environment variable that points to your app, e.g.
  `https://myapp.com`. This variable can also be used to override the default
  URL in development which is `http://localhost:3000` unless specified
  otherwise.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  If you don't already have a uploadthing secret key, [sign up](https://uploadthing.com/sign-in) and create one from
  the [dashboard!](https://uploadthing.com/dashboard)
</Callout>
</Steps>
