# Getting Started

UploadThing works with a lot of backend libraries, fullstack frameworks as well
as a few frontend UI libraries. Start out by selecting the backend framework
your app is using.

## Full Stack Frameworks

- [Next.js App Router](/frameworks/nextjs-app)
- [Next.js Pages Router](/frameworks/nextjs-pages)
- [SolidStart](/frameworks/solidstart)

## Standalone Backend Libraries

- [Express](/backend-adapters/express)
- [Fastify](/backend-adapters/fastify)
- [H3 / Nitro](/backend-adapters/h3)

We also support any server compliant with the [WinterCG](https://wintercg.org/)
specification, meaning your framework is based on the Web Standard APIs Request
and Response, e.g. Astro, Deno Deploy, Cloudflare Workers, Edge Runtime, Elysia,
Hono etc. [See examples here](/backend-adapters/fetch).
