We could not detect a valid reproduction link. **Make sure to follow the bug report template carefully.**

### Why was this issue closed?

To be able to investigate, we need access to a reproduction to identify what triggered the issue. We need a link to a **public** GitHub repository or a sandbox like Codesandbox or Stackblitz.

The bug template that you filled out has a section called "Link to reproduction", which is where you should provide the link to the reproduction.

- If you did not provide a link or the link you provided is not valid, we will close the issue.
- If you provide a link to a private repository, we will close the issue.
- If you provide a link to a repository but not in the correct section, we will close the issue.

### What should I do?

Depending on the reason the issue was closed, you can do the following:

- If you did not provide a link, please open a new issue with a link to a reproduction.
- If you provided a link to a private repository, please open a new issue with a link to a public repository.
- If you provided a link to a repository but not in the correct section, please open a new issue with a link to a reproduction in the correct section.

To create a good reproduction, we recommend starting from [one of our many examples](https://github.com/pingdotgg/uploadthing/tree/main/examples), either by

- Opening it in for example Stackblitz: `https://stackblitz.com/github/pingdotgg/uploadthing/tree/main/examples/<EXAMPLE_NAME_HERE>`
- Cloning it down locally using something like `degit`: `npx degit pingdotgg/uploadthing/examples/<EXAMPLE_NAME_HERE>`
